=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::XMPP::Component - "XML" stream that implements the XEP-0114

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use AnyEvent::XMPP::Component;

   my $con = AnyEvent::XMPP::Component->new (
                domain => 'chat.jabber.org'
                server => 'jabber.org',
                port   => 5347,
                secret => 'insecurepasswordforthehackers'
             );
   $con->reg_cb (session_ready => sub { ... });
   $con->connect;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module represents a XMPP connection to a server that authenticates as
component.

This module is a subclass of C<AnyEvent::XMPP::Connection> and inherits all methods.
For example C<reg_cb> and the stanza sending routines.

For additional events that can be registered to look below in the EVENTS section.

Please note that for component several functionality in L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Connection>
might have no effect or not the desired effect. Basically you should
use the L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Component> as component and only handle events
the handle with incoming data. And only use functions that send stanzas.

No effect has the event C<stream_pre_authentication> and the C<authenticate>
method of L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Connection>, because those handle the usual SASL or iq-auth
authentication. "Jabber" components have a completly different authentication
mechanism.

Also note that the support for some XEPs in L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Ext> is just thought
for client side usage, if you miss any functionaly don't hesitate to ask the
author or send him a patch! (See L<AnyEvent::XMPP> for contact information).

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<new (%args)>

This is the constructor. It takes the same arguments as
the constructor of L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Connection> along with a
few others:

B<NOTE>: Please note that some arguments that L<AnyEvent::XMPP::Connection>
usually takes have no effect when using this class. (That would be
the 'username', 'password', 'resource' and 'jid' arguments for example.)

=over 4

=item secret => $secret

C<$secret> is the secret that will be used for authentication with the server.

=head1 EVENTS

These additional events can be registered on with C<reg_cb>:

NOTE: The event C<stream_pre_authentication> should _not_ be handled
and just ignored. Don't attach callbacks to it!

=over 4

=item session_ready

This event indicates that the component has connected successfully
and can now be used to transmit stanzas.
